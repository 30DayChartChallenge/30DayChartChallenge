# The Challenge

The <b style='font-weight:800;'>#30DayChartChallenge</b> is a community-driven challenge that happens each year during April. Every day, there is a certain prompt, grouped into five categories: comparisons, distributions, relationships, time series, and uncertainties. Anyone is welcome to contribute, no matter which data source or tool is used to create the visualizations.<br><br>
The first edition was run in 2021 with 1,960 contributions from all over the world. The challenge is inspired by the <a href='https://30daymapchallenge.com/'>#30DayMapChallenge</a> which was initiated by Topi Tjukanov in 2019.
